# Next.js Starter

> A small layer on top of Next.js for fast hacking

This is meant as a base for websites built with React and Styled Components, including:

- most stand-alone sites
- quick prototypes
- static generated sites (handled using Next.js)
- sites needing a simple API (using Next.js API routes)
- â€¦and more!

It may be better to use a different project for some situations - see the [main readme] for options:

- projects embedded within a page on a site (e.g. using a script tag)
- sites heavily tied to a CMS
  - A CMS's API can be used (e.g. using API routes), but we're working on more robust projects that build on this one that are more oriented toward CMS-driven sites

## How to Use

This is an example repository that is ready to be set up. With [Yarn] installed,
run:

```bash
npx create-gsandf-project --example nextjs new-site-name
```

This creates a new project in the current directory called `new-site-name`.

## Getting Started

[Node.js] and [Yarn] are required to work with this project.

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the local server to get started:

```bash
yarn dev
```

See below for other scripts.
